# Customer Compass development guide

This folder is the durable engineering record for the learning project. Read the
stage documents in order; each stage has a working boundary and must be verified
before the next stage changes its assumptions.

Stages are grouped into **Parts** so the roadmap stays navigable as new topics
are added. Each part is its own folder; new parts can be appended later without
disrupting earlier ones.

## Part I — Foundations
*Get a working CRM + basic AI loop running locally.*

| Stage | Status | Document |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. CRM foundation | Complete | [01-foundation.md](part-1-foundations/01-foundation.md) |
| 2. First local LLM chat | Complete | [02-first-llm-chat.md](part-1-foundations/02-first-llm-chat.md) |
| 3. Basic RAG | Complete | [03-basic-rag.md](part-1-foundations/03-basic-rag.md) |

## Part II — Grounded Intelligence
*Make answers accurate, realistic, and provider-flexible.*

| Stage | Status | Document |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4. Cloud LLM provider option | Planned | [04-cloud-llm-provider.md](part-2-grounded-intelligence/04-cloud-llm-provider.md) |
| 5. Realistic CRM RAG | Planned | [05-realistic-crm-rag.md](part-2-grounded-intelligence/05-realistic-crm-rag.md) |
| 6. Retrieval evaluation | Planned | [06-retrieval-evaluation.md](part-2-grounded-intelligence/06-retrieval-evaluation.md) |

## Part III — Trust & Safety
*Make it credible and safe before adding autonomy.*

| Stage | Status | Document |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7. Production concerns | Planned | [07-production-concerns.md](part-3-trust-safety/07-production-concerns.md) |
| 8. Prompt-injection defense & guardrails | Planned | [08-prompt-injection-guardrails.md](part-3-trust-safety/08-prompt-injection-guardrails.md) |

## Part IV — Autonomy & Protocols
*Let the assistant act, using modern standards.*

| Stage | Status | Document |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9. Tool calling via MCP | Planned | [09-tool-calling-mcp.md](part-4-autonomy-protocols/09-tool-calling-mcp.md) |
| 10. Agentic CRM assistant | Planned | [10-agentic-assistant.md](part-4-autonomy-protocols/10-agentic-assistant.md) |

## Baseline stack

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Backend: Express + TypeScript
- Relational data: PostgreSQL 17 in Docker
- Local inference: Ollama + Qwen2.5 3B in Docker
- Cloud inference (Stage 4+): one free-tier provider (Groq/OpenRouter/Gemini),
  swappable via configuration

This is an intentionally small, original CRM. It uses only synthetic data and
does not reproduce an existing CRM product.

See [conversation-progress.md](conversation-progress.md) for a concise running
record of decisions, completed work, environment setup, and the next stage.

See [tech-stack.md](tech-stack.md) for a cross-cutting reference of the
active technology per capability (LLM inference, embeddings, vector storage,
tool calling, guardrails, evaluation), what alternatives are already wired in
as opt-in toggles, and other free options worth exploring — updated as new
stages introduce new choices.

## Archive

[`archive-01/`](archive-01/) contains a frozen snapshot of the original flat
8-stage numbering, kept for history. It is not maintained going forward — use
the Part-based index above.

## Developer note

Keep this index updated whenever a stage changes from Planned to Complete, its
implementation scope changes, or a new stage/part is added. Every stage document
includes a **How to run the app** and **How to test manually** section — the
manual steps are independent of (and in addition to) any automated test suite.
