# Stage 3 — Basic RAG

**Status:** Completed

## Goal

Build a transparent Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline using synthetic CRM
documents. The output must be grounded and cite its source chunks.

## Implemented design

```text
Document -> parse (frontmatter + body) -> chunk (600 chars, 100 overlap)
         -> embed (Ollama mxbai-embed-large, 1024-dim) -> store (pgvector)
Question -> embed -> cosine similarity search (<=>) -> top chunks (>= 0.3 similarity)
         -> numbered context block -> LLM (grounded system prompt) -> answer + citations
```

- Vector storage: `pgvector` extension inside the existing PostgreSQL service
  (image switched to `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`). No ANN index yet — the corpus
  is small enough for an exact `<=>` scan; Stage 5 revisits indexing.
- Embeddings: local Ollama model `mxbai-embed-large`, called through
  `apps/api/src/rag/embeddings.ts`.
- Chunking: explicit character-based sliding window in
  `apps/api/src/rag/chunking.ts` (`CHUNK_SIZE=600`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP=100`),
  unit-tested in `chunking.test.ts`.
- Ingestion (`apps/api/src/rag/ingest.ts`): reads every `.md` file in
  `sample-data/documents/`, parses YAML frontmatter (`title`, `type`,
  optional `company`) with `gray-matter`, resolves `company` to an existing
  `companies.id`, truncates and re-inserts `documents`/`document_chunks` on
  each run, and records each run in `ingestion_runs`.
- Retrieval (`apps/api/src/rag/retrieve.ts`): embeds the question, runs a
  cosine-similarity query joining `document_chunks` → `documents` →
  `companies`, and builds a numbered, citable context block.
- Routes:
  - `POST /api/documents/ingest` — runs the full pipeline.
  - `GET /api/documents` — lists ingested documents with chunk counts.
  - `GET /api/documents/ingestion-runs` — ingestion history/debugging.
  - `POST /api/chat/rag` — grounded chat; returns `{ message, citations[] }`.
  - `POST /api/chat` — unchanged general chat from Stage 2 (now its own router).
- UI: an "Ingest documents" button, a "Use document knowledge (RAG)" toggle,
  and numbered citations (title, company, doc type, similarity score) shown
  under grounded answers.

Synthetic documents (`sample-data/documents/`) cover emails, call notes,
support conversations, and two product/service overviews, cross-referenced
with the three companies already in the CRM database — this sets up Stage 4's
DB + RAG linkage.

## Learning boundaries

- Explain and implement chunk size, overlap, embeddings, similarity scoring,
  retrieval, context construction, and citations explicitly.
- Keep document ingestion distinct from query-time retrieval.
- Add a way to inspect chunks and retrieved sources for debugging.
- Do not use tools/agent loops or hide the pipeline behind a broad framework.

## Acceptance criteria

A developer can ingest sample documents, ask a document-supported question, see
the answer’s citations, and verify the cited source text.

Verified: ingested 8 documents into 16 chunks; asked "Does the Fleet
Visibility package include alerting, and can alerts be set per customer?"
through `POST /api/chat/rag` and received a correct, cited answer referencing
the product overview and the matching support conversation.

## Developer note

Changed/added files:

- `docker-compose.yml` — `db` image switched to `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`;
  mounts `db/002-rag.sql`.
- `db/002-rag.sql` — pgvector extension, `documents`, `document_chunks`,
  `ingestion_runs` tables. Runs automatically only on a fresh volume; apply
  manually to an existing volume with
  `docker exec -i customer-compass-db psql -U customer_compass -d customer_compass < db/002-rag.sql`.
- `apps/api/src/rag/chunking.ts` (+ test), `embeddings.ts`, `ingest.ts`,
  `retrieve.ts`.
- `apps/api/src/routes/documents.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/chat.ts` (extracted
  from `app.ts`, added the `/rag` grounded endpoint).
- `sample-data/documents/*.md` — 8 synthetic documents.
- `apps/web/src/main.tsx`, `apps/web/src/styles.css` — ingestion control, RAG
  toggle, citation rendering.
- `apps/api/package.json` — fixed the `test` script glob (`src/**/*.test.ts`
  silently matched only one directory level without bash `globstar`, so
  `app.test.ts` was never actually running; now wrapped with
  `bash -O globstar`).

Useful commands:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db ollama
docker exec customer-compass-ollama ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/documents/ingest
```

## Local testing

Full walkthrough to bring the stage up from a clean checkout and verify it
works.

### 1. Start infrastructure

```bash
cd /home/devarapallim/Murali/git-personal/customer-compass
docker-compose up -d db ollama
```

- **First time / fresh volume**: `db/init.sql` and `db/002-rag.sql` both run
  automatically (mounted as ordered init scripts).
- **Existing volume from before Stage 3** (already had `companies`,
  `contacts`, `deals`, `interactions`): the container image changes to
  `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`, but Postgres init scripts only run once against an
  empty data directory, so apply the new schema manually:

  ```bash
  docker exec -i customer-compass-db psql -U customer_compass -d customer_compass < db/002-rag.sql
  ```

  Verify it worked: `\dt` inside `psql` should list `documents`,
  `document_chunks`, and `ingestion_runs` alongside the Stage 1 tables.

### 2. Pull the models

```bash
docker exec customer-compass-ollama ollama pull qwen2.5:3b        # Stage 2 chat model
docker exec customer-compass-ollama ollama pull mxbai-embed-large # Stage 3 embedding model
docker exec customer-compass-ollama ollama list                   # confirm both are present
```

### 3. Install dependencies and start the app

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs the API (`http://localhost:3001`) and the web UI
(`http://localhost:5173`) together. Confirm the API is healthy:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001/health
# expect: {"status":"ok"}
```

### 4. Run automated tests

```bash
cd apps/api && npm test
```

Expect **6 passing tests**: 2 route-level tests in `app.test.ts` (including
the chat validation test — previously silently skipped before the glob fix)
and 4 chunking unit tests in `chunking.test.ts`.

Also confirm both apps type-check and build cleanly:

```bash
cd apps/api && npx tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit && npm run build
cd ../web && npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit && npm run build
```

### 5. Ingest the sample documents

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/documents/ingest | python3 -m json.tool
```

Observe: `"status": "completed"`, `"documentsProcessed": 8`,
`"chunksCreated": 16`. Then inspect what was stored:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/documents | python3 -m json.tool
```

Observe: 8 documents, each with `chunk_count: 2`, and `company_name` set for
the 6 company-specific documents (`null` for the 2 product overviews).

### 6. Ask a grounded question

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat/rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Does the Fleet Visibility package include alerting, and can alerts be set per customer?"}]}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

Observe:
- `message` answers the question and includes bracketed citation markers
  like `[1]`, `[2]`.
- `citations` is a non-empty array; each entry's `title`/`snippet` should
  plausibly support the claim in `message` (for this question, expect the
  "Fleet Visibility rollout package overview" and "Pre-sales support
  conversation on alerting limits" documents to appear with high
  `similarity`, roughly 0.7–0.85).

Also confirm Stage 2's ungrounded chat still works unaffected:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi in 5 words."}]}'
```

Observe: a `message` field with no `citations` key.

### 7. Verify in the browser

Open `http://localhost:5173`:

- The chat panel shows an "Ingest documents" button and a "Use document
  knowledge (RAG)" checkbox.
- Click "Ingest documents" and observe the status line report documents and
  chunks ingested (matches step 5).
- With the RAG checkbox **unchecked**, ask a general question — answered with
  no citations shown.
- With the RAG checkbox **checked**, ask the Fleet Visibility question from
  step 6 — the assistant's reply should appear with a numbered citations list
  underneath it (title, company, doc type, similarity score).
