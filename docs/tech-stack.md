# Tech stack and alternatives

This is a living, cross-cutting reference of the technology used in Customer
Compass. It's organized two ways:

1. **[Progress by stage](#progress-by-stage)** — a color-coded, chronological
   walkthrough of what each stage added, best for seeing the stack build up
   incrementally as a learner.
2. **By capability** (LLM inference, embeddings, vector storage, tool
   calling, etc.) — the detailed reference further down, best for looking up
   what's active/swappable for one specific technology area.

Either way, this file exists so a learner can see, at a glance, what is
currently active, what swappable alternative is already wired in (or
planned), and what other free options are worth exploring next.

**Update this file whenever a new stage introduces a new technology choice or
a new swappable alternative.** Individual stage documents describe the
*implementation details and acceptance criteria*; this file is the map across
all of them.

## How swapping works

Where an alternative is available, it is wired in as an **additive, opt-in
toggle** — never a silent replacement (see `docs/conversation-progress.md` for
this project's standing strategy). Two mechanisms are used:

1. **Environment variable** (application-level choice, e.g. which LLM
   provider or vector store the API talks to).
2. **Commented-out Docker Compose service** — the alternative's service
   definition exists in `docker-compose.yml` but is commented out by default.
   Uncomment it, set the matching environment variable, and restart to try it;
   comment it back out to return to the default with no other changes.
3. **Live UI selector, per request** (LLM provider and, for the cloud
   provider, the specific model) — the web app lets the user pick the
   provider from a dropdown on every message, no restart needed; when
   "Cloud" is selected, a second dropdown lets them pick any currently
   available free OpenRouter model (fetched live from `GET /api/llm/models`),
   with paid examples shown disabled for reference only. The server still
   supports env-var defaults (`LLM_PROVIDER`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL`) for clients
   that don't specify one (e.g. curl/tests).

## Progress by stage

A chronological, color-coded view of what each stage added — read top to
bottom to see the stack build up incrementally. Completed stages get a
distinct color per stage; planned/not-yet-built stages are grey. The
per-capability tables further below are the detailed reference for the same
information, organized the other way (by technology, not by stage).

![Stage 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_1-CRM_Foundation-6f42c1) **— done**
- **PostgreSQL 17** (Docker) — relational store for companies, contacts,
  deals, interactions. No LLM/AI yet.

![Stage 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_2-First_LLM_Chat-0969da) **— done**
- **Ollama** (local, Docker) running **`qwen2.5:3b`** — the first chat/
  completion model, called from `/api/chat`. No CRM data access yet.

![Stage 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_3-Basic_RAG-1a7f37) **— done**
- **Ollama embeddings**, `mxbai-embed-large` (1024-dim) — turns ingested CRM
  documents into vectors.
- **PostgreSQL + `pgvector`** — added to the *same* database as the CRM
  tables, storing and searching those embeddings. `/api/chat/rag` grounds
  answers in retrieved, cited chunks.

![Stage 4](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_4-Cloud_LLM_Provider-e36209) **— done**
- **OpenRouter** (cloud, free tier) — a swappable alternative to Ollama for
  chat/completion, wired in additively (Ollama still works unchanged).
  Selectable **live, per request** from the web UI: a "Model" dropdown
  (Local Ollama / Cloud OpenRouter), and — when Cloud is picked — a second
  "OpenRouter model" dropdown listing all current free models (selectable)
  plus a couple of paid examples (greyed out, reference only). Backed by
  `GET /api/llm/models`.

![Stage 5](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_5-Realistic_CRM_RAG-lightgrey) **— planned**
- No new technology choice recorded yet; see
  `docs/part-2-grounded-intelligence/05-realistic-crm-rag.md`.

![Stage 6](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_6-Retrieval_Evaluation-lightgrey) **— planned**
- Custom benchmark (`evals/questions.json`) + LLM-as-judge. Alternatives to
  explore: RAGAS, DeepEval, promptfoo.

![Stage 7](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_7-Production_Concerns-lightgrey) **— planned**
- Model fallback between providers, cost/latency tracking — design not
  finalized yet.

![Stage 8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_8-Prompt_Injection_Guardrails-lightgrey) **— planned**
- Custom rule-based guard + delimited untrusted-content prompting.
  Alternatives to explore: NeMo Guardrails, Llama Guard, Guardrails AI.

![Stage 9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_9-Tool_Calling_MCP-lightgrey) **— planned**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) — provider-agnostic tool calling, matching how
  modern AI tools (including this CLI) expose tools today.

![Stage 10](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage_10-Agentic_Assistant-lightgrey) **— planned**
- Not yet designed.

## LLM inference (chat/completion)

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Active (default)** | Ollama, local, `qwen2.5:3b` | Stage 2 |
| **Swappable alternative** | OpenRouter (cloud, free tier), selectable live per request via the web UI's "Model" dropdown, or `provider: "cloud"` in the request body, or `LLM_PROVIDER=cloud` as the server-side default | Stage 4 |

Current OpenRouter default free model: `liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free`. Since
free-tier slugs get promoted to paid-only or rate-limited under shared-pool
contention frequently, the web UI additionally exposes a second **"OpenRouter
model"** dropdown (visible when "Cloud" is selected) populated live from
`GET /api/llm/models` — the user can pick any currently free model per
message, no server restart or `.env` edit needed. A couple of well-known paid
models (GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet 4) are listed alongside for reference but
rendered disabled/greyed out — never selectable, so no request can
accidentally incur cost. See `apps/api/.env.example` for a curl one-liner to
inspect the raw free-model list server-side if needed.

Free options worth exploring later:

- **Groq** — very low latency, OpenAI-compatible API, generous free tier.
- **Google Gemini (free tier)** — strong quality, own SDK shape.
- **Together.ai** — free credits, OpenAI-compatible.

## Embeddings

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Active (default)** | Ollama, local, `mxbai-embed-large` (1024-dim) | Stage 3 |
| **Swappable alternative** | Not yet planned | — |

Free options worth exploring later:

- **Cohere** — free-tier embed API, strong retrieval performance.
- **Google `text-embedding-004`** — free-tier via Gemini API.
- **Sentence-Transformers** (self-hosted, e.g. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) — fully
  free/local, smaller/faster than `mxbai-embed-large`, good for comparing
  embedding quality vs. speed trade-offs.

## Vector storage / retrieval database

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Active (default)** | PostgreSQL + `pgvector` extension (same DB as CRM tables) | Stage 3 |
| **Swappable alternative** | Qdrant (self-hosted, Docker), via `VECTOR_STORE=qdrant` | Planned |

`pgvector` is genuinely production-viable at this project's scale (see
discussion in `docs/conversation-progress.md`) — this is not a "toy vs. real"
comparison, but a "one database vs. a purpose-built vector database"
trade-off worth learning hands-on.

Free options worth exploring later:

- **Qdrant** — open-source, self-hosted via Docker, easy DX; the first
  alternative wired into `docker-compose.yml` (see below).
- **Chroma** — simplest to start with, embedded or server mode, common in RAG
  tutorials.
- **Weaviate** — built-in hybrid (BM25 + vector) search, directly relevant to
  Stage 6's hybrid-retrieval goal.
- **Milvus / Zilliz Cloud** — industry-standard at large scale; free cloud
  tier available.
- **pgvector + pgvectorscale** (Timescale extension) — adds StreamingDiskANN
  to pgvector itself, no separate database needed; worth trying before
  reaching for a dedicated vector DB.

## Tool calling protocol

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planned (default)** | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Stage 9 |
| **Alternative worth knowing** | Native provider function-calling (OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini function-calling schemas) | Not wired in — reference only |

MCP is the standard used going forward because it is provider-agnostic and
matches how modern AI tools (including this CLI) expose tools today.

## Guardrails / prompt-injection defense

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planned (default)** | Custom rule-based guard + delimited untrusted-content prompting | Stage 8 |
| **Alternatives worth exploring** | NeMo Guardrails, Llama Guard, Guardrails AI | Not yet wired in |

## Evaluation

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planned (default)** | Custom benchmark (`evals/questions.json`) + LLM-as-judge | Stage 6 |
| **Alternatives worth exploring** | RAGAS, DeepEval, promptfoo | Not yet wired in |

## Relational / application database

| | Technology | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Active** | PostgreSQL 17 (Docker) | Stage 1 |

No alternative planned — this holds the core CRM data and is not swapped.

## Maintenance

- Add a new row/section here the same time a new stage introduces a
  swappable technology choice.
- Keep the "Active" column accurate — if a stage promotes an alternative to
  the new default, update this file and note the change in
  `docs/conversation-progress.md`.
